      <p><i>Normal People Are Boring — Let's Build a Static SPA</i></p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://pinkavocadodev.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinkavocadodev.github.io</a></strong> is my pride and joy. As mentioned on the Home tab, it's a personal space where I showcase my projects and highlight my skills.</p>
      <p>Among those skills: Angular, and — admittedly — some <em>questionable</em> design instincts. So, what better way to put them on display than by making them the literal front page of my work?</p>
      <p>This very website is built as a <strong>Single Page Application (SPA)</strong>, using Angular to provide a fast, smooth user experience without page reloads.</p>
      <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> It follows the <a href="https://m3.material.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Material 3</a> (aka Material You) design system.</p>

      <h1>Posso Andare Al Mare?</h1>
      <p><i>"Can you go to the beach today?" Here's your answer.</i></p>
      <p><strong>Posso Andare Al Mare</strong> is a web app that gives a simple, direct answer — <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong> — to the question: <em>"Is today a good day to go to the beach?"</em> It covers nearly all Italian beaches and offers forecasts up to 7 days in advance, all in a sleek modern GUI.</p>
      <p>The app fetches weather data from the <a href="https://open-meteo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenMeteo.com API</a> and processes it to provide an intuitive, easy-to-understand result. For those who want more detail, a popup shows wind speed, average temperature, sun intensity, cloud coverage, and more.</p>
      <p>Built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app is live at <a href="http://possoandarealmare.altervista.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possoandarealmare.altervista.org</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> It meets modern web standards and can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) via Chromium or Safari.</p>

      <h1>TF2 Web Remote</h1>
      <p><i>A Web-Based Control Panel for Team Fortress 2 Servers.</i></p>
      <p>TF2 Web Remote is a project I developed in collaboration with two friends. It provides a sleek and user-friendly web interface for managing personal Team Fortress 2 servers.</p>
      <p>With this control panel, users can easily:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select the game mode and map stage;</li>
        <li>Adjust the number of bots;</li>
        <li>Monitor and manage server settings in real time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The backend is powered by a Python server that communicates directly with Valve’s native server API, sending commands to the remote machine. The setup is fully customizable through a <code>config.yml</code> file, where you can define parameters like IP address, ports, and other admin preferences.</p>

      <h1>VenPatch</h1>
      <p><i>A GTK4 and Libadwaita app for Vencord patching.</i></p>
      <p>I love Vencord—the themes, icons, and added utilities are fantastic! But there’s a catch: Discord updates frequently, and every update tends to break Vencord, requiring it to be re-patched.</p>
      <p>If you're on Windows (ew), this isn't a big deal—the Vencord team provides a handy re-patching utility with a simple click-to-run interface. On Linux, though, you're left re-running a curl command to download and execute the Go-based installer script. Tedious.</p>
      <p>That’s why I made VenPatch—a GTK4 and Libadwaita app that wraps the official Vencord installer in a clean, modern GUI. With VenPatch, you can Install, Repair, or Uninstall Vencord with just a few clicks.</p>
      <p>Bonus: VenPatch is fully compliant with the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines (aka the GNOME Design Bible).</p>

      <p>I made this extension back when the invasion of Ukraine had just begun, it replaces all instances of Vladimir Putin with Vladolf Putler—just seems fitting :)</p>

      <h1>Conserva Fatture</h1>
      <p><i>One of my first GUI apps, built using the EasyPyGUI library.</i></p>
      <p>This tool prepares invoice data packets for submission to the Italian Revenue Agency (Agenzia delle Entrate). It scans a specified folder, identifies and groups <code>.XML</code> and <code>.P7M</code> invoice files—excluding irrelevant metadata—and organizes them into batches of 10 for compliance and transmission.</p>
