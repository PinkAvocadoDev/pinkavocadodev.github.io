Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Andrea. I'm 27 and an undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Tor Vergata, and a full-stack developer with a passion for web and mobile development.

This website is a space where you can find all the projects I've been working on—both my own and those I've collaborated on. Enjoy your stay!

I'm also a Linux enthusiast (Ubuntu FTW—don’t fight me), and yes, I have used Arch, btw.
